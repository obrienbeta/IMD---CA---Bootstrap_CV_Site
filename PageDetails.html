										<h3>Implemented Bootstrap Features:</h3>
										<p>navbar-static-top - The static top navbar sticks the navbar to the top of the screen so when the website is scrolled it remains at the top of the screen.</p>
										<p>class="well well-lg" - I used the well feature of bootstrap to hold the text and table content on the page as it gave the website a user friendly structure but also kept each section separate.</p>
										<p>class="modal fade" - The modal fade feature of bootstrap was used to create a modal dialog box to hold contact information. The modal fade will fade in on click of the photo in the hero component.</p>
										<p>class = "table table-inverse" - The table feature of bootstrap allowed me to build a table to hold previous work experience and the inverse feature calls bootstrap CSS to style the table</p>
										<p>class="col-lg-6 image - The col-lg-6 image feature is structuring a component of half the size of the screen and the image feature is designed to hold an image.</p>
										<p>class="carousel slide" - The carousel slide feature allowed me to call on bootstrap functionality to place a slide show into one of the columns on the site.</p>
										<p>class="carousel-inner"- This feature allows you to place an image into the carousel at a particular point or slide number.</p>
										<p>class="left carousel-control" - The carousel control allows the carousel glyphicon to switch between the images</p>
										<p>class="panel panel-primary" - I used panels in the last row of the website to hold additional information. The panels are designed to be closed on load and jquery handles the events to open and close them after</p>
										<p>class = "table table-hover" - The table hover feature was added for the color of the table rows to darken and text to become clearer on hover.</p>
										<p>class="pull-right clickable" - </p>

						<p>Row 1 - The first Row is designed give the introductory information required and a small overview. The photo in this component is connected to a modal dialog box the holds contact information</p>
						<p>Row 2 - The second Row is designed to cover previous work and work placement. There is a button link added to navigate to my work placement companies website for more information. Inside this row there is a well which holds a hover table, each of the rows in the table are handled with jquery to pop a modal dialog box containing contact information for each of the employers. </p>
						<p>Row 3 - This row is designed to give an overview of technological interests. It is split into two columns and in each column a well to hold the content of each of the technology sections.</p>								
						<p>Row 4 - The last row holds three panels, each panel is collapsed on page load, I added an if and else statement using jquery to handle the onclick of chevron glyphicons on each panel so it can toggle between activating and collapsing..</p>

										<h3>JQuery:</h3>
										<p>To handle the onclick modal dialog pop up on the work experience table I used jquery with data targets to target which row was being clicked and which modal dialog each row is connected to. The modal dialogs are triggered by the show command.</p>
										<p>To Handle the panels collapsable panels at the bottom of the page i used an if and else statement to handle the dropdown functionality of a panel. On load of the page each panel will be collapsed and using the glyphicons on the panel headings the panels can be dropped down revealing the content. </p>
										<p>To handle the panels on load I used a remove class command to remove the class from the CSS on load and this hides the panel until provoked by the other script to activate the dropdown of the panel.</p>
